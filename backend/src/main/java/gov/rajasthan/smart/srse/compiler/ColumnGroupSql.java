     * <ul>

     *       at all, whatever its null semantics elsewhere.</li>
     *   <li>A NULL or empty middle name must not leave a doubled separator.
     *       Against Levenshtein that stray separator is a free edit charged to
     *       every row with a missing middle name, systematically depressing the
     *       similarity of exactly those records. Verified: folding
     *       {@code ['Ram', NULL, 'Sharma']} with the filter gives edit distance
     *       0 against {@code 'Ram Sharma'}; without it, 1.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Collapsing whitespace afterwards would fix only the space case; filtering
     * first is correct for any separator.
     *
     * <p>Every member is cast to VARCHAR: a combined value is textual by
     * construction, and ARRAY requires one element type.
