/**
 * Emits the casts that let two operands of different physical types be
 * compared, instead of letting Presto reject the query.
 *
 * <p><b>The problem.</b> The same business identifier is routinely stored with
 * different types in different tables — an account number as {@code varchar}
 * in the transaction table and {@code bigint} in the golden layer, a flag as
 * {@code varchar} on one side and {@code boolean} on the other. Presto does
 * not implicitly coerce across those families, so the comparison fails to
 * compile: {@code '=' cannot be applied to varchar, bigint}. Text functions
 * are just as strict — {@code lower(bigint)} is {@code Unexpected parameters},
 * which is why a fuzzy pair needs its own treatment.
 *
 * <p><b>What this does NOT do.</b> Nothing, when both operands are in the same
 * {@link SqlTypeFamily}: Presto already coerces integer↔bigint↔decimal,
 * varchar(20)↔varchar(50) and date↔timestamp correctly, and wrapping those in
 * a cast could only change results. Nothing either when a side's type is
 * {@link SqlTypeFamily#UNKNOWN} — a cast SRSE cannot reason about is more
 * likely to break a working query than to fix a broken one.
 *
 * <p><b>Direction.</b> For the mixed case that actually matters — number vs
 * text — the default is to compare AS NUMBERS, with the text side going
 * through {@code TRY_CAST}. See {@link CompareAs#AUTO} for why, and
 * {@link CompareAs} for the per-column admin override that forces the other
 * direction. {@code TRY_CAST} rather than {@code CAST} throughout: a single
 * unparseable row must not fail the whole match, and a NULL simply does not
 * match, which is the outcome that row would have had anyway.
